# Obstacle_Avoidance_car
Obstacle avoidance in autonomous cars is a critical capability that allows a vehicle to navigate safely by detecting and avoiding obstacles in its environment.<br> This process involves multiple technologies and strategies to ensure the vehicle can respond in real-time to potential hazards, ensuring smooth and safe driving.
# Key components
<b>1. </b>Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that will control the entire system.<br>
<b>2. </b>Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04): Used to measure distance to obstacles.<br>
<b>3. </b>DC Motors with Motor Driver (e.g., L298N): To control the movement of the car.<br>
<b>4. </b>Servo Motor: If you want to control steering.<br>
<b>5. </b>Power Supply: For Arduino and motors.<br>
<b>6. </b>Chassis and Wheels: For constructing the car base.<br>
<b>7. </b>Jumper Wires and Breadboard: For connecting the component.<br>
